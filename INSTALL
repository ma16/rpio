INSTALLATION NOTES

The project provides only the source code and needs to be compiled in order to create an executable tool. The source is written in C++11. The platform must be POSIX compliant (e.g. Raspbian) and needs to support /dev/mem and /dev/vcio. The tool runs in userland. 

Contributions: This project uses the Boost library (see http://www.boost.org).

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

$ sudo apt-get -y install libboost-dev 
$ wget https://github.com/ma16/rpio/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master
$ cd rpio-master/cc
$ make -j6
$ Console/rpio

The last line should give you a diagnostic message with the supported options. The program needs to be executed as root unless the permissions of /dev/mem and /dev/vcio are changed.

Notes:
* At the time of writing, Raspbian installed libbost1.55. The package installation may take a few minutes.
* Since a 4-core ARM is used, make is executed with 6 threads (-j6). Still, it may take several minutes until make finishes.
* Master branch and releases prior to 2017/09/21 require GCC 4.8 (g++) or older. That is, GCC 4.9 and newer will fail.

RASPBIAN INSTALLATION

The following description may be helpful if you install Raspbian for the first time. A (fresh) Raspbian image (2017-04-10) is used. The SD card, which will be used on the Raspberry Pi, is prepared beforehand on a Linux desktop (as /dev/sdX where X is a wildcard for the proper device).

Copy Image:

$ wget http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2017-04-10/2017-04-10-raspbian-jessie.zip
$ unzip -p 2017-04-10-raspbian-jessie.zip | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4096 status=progress

Headless Pi with SSHD (WLAN):

$ sudo mkdir -p /media/pi
$ sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /media/pi
$ sudo touch /media/pi/ssh
$ sudo umount /media/pi
$ sudo mount /dev/sdX2 /media/pi
sudo tee -a /media/pi/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf << EOF
network={
    ssid="APN"
    psk="PASSWORD"
}
EOF
$ sudo umount /media/pi
$ sudo rmdir /media/pi

Where /dev/sdX is the SD card; APN and PASSWORD are the WLAN login details.

Boot for the first time:

The SD card is inserted into a Raspberry Pi-2 (BCM2836) and the Pi is booted up. Beside others, the file system is expanded automatially to cover the full SD card size. It may take a moment.

Login if you use the console. Start up a terminal if you use the GUI. Remote connect with ssh if sshd was already set up. The default hostname is raspberrypi, the user is "pi" and the password is "raspberry".

E.g.
$ ssh pi@raspberrypi
[raspberry]

Change password:

$ passwd
[raspberry]
[new-password]
[new-password]

In case you need to set up SSH and WLAN (if not already done):

$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
$ sudo tee -a /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf << EOF
network={
    ssid="APN"
    psk="PASSWORD"
}
EOF

Change hostname (here: "demopi") to prevent conflicts with other Raspberry Pis (if any):

$ echo demopi | sudo tee /etc/hostname
$ sudo sed -i s/raspberrypi/demopi/ /etc/hosts
$ sudo reboot
$ ssh pi@demopi
[new-password]

You may want to invoke raspi-config instead to make these changes and for further setups. If your system is connected to the internet, you may want to consider also additional security measures.
