Raspberry Pi: Memory and I/O Throughput

The Raspberry Pi provides, besides others, several I/O pins, paired with a reasonable amount of memory (RAM) and a Linux operating system. Thus, data sampling becomes quite easy even for user-space applications. This projects tries to estimate an upper bound for the I/O throughput.

For the findings refer to [Throughput.pdf] (https://github.com/ma16/rpio/raw/release.1/doc/Throughput.pdf).
