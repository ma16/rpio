# Raspberry Pi Input Output (RPIO)

This is a project to gain access to the Raspberry Pi's peripherals via C++11. 

You may want to have a look at the peripheral [library](cc/Rpi) and at the console [program](cc/Console).

The implementation is far from being finished. Present interfaces may change any time.

However, there are a few (unstable) releases available:

* [release.3](https://github.com/ma16/rpio/tree/release.3): New console options (e.g. clock, MCP3008)
* [release.2](https://github.com/ma16/rpio/tree/release.2): MAX7219 Support with Examples (Dot-Matrix)
* [release.1](https://github.com/ma16/rpio/tree/release.1): [Memory Throughput Test](https://github.com/ma16/rpio/blob/release.1/doc/Throughput.pdf)
