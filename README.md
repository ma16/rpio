# rpio -- Raspberry Pi Input Output

release.? (Unstable)

* Support of a few GPIO functions

* Script controlled 8x8 (cascaded) Dot-Matrices (MAX7219)

  Example: count from 1 to 1000 on 3 matrices

  $ gunzip -c data/Max7219/count-3-1-1000-0.05.gz | sudo Main/rpio max7219 23 24 25 -i

  Example: Ticker "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." (5 matrices)

  $ gunzip -c data/Max7219/ticker-5-fox.gz | sudo Main/rpio max7219 23 24 25 -i

  The script files are generated by Perl. See script/Max7219 directory.

release.1 (Unstable)

* The Raspberry Pi provides, besides others, several I/O pins, paired with a reasonable amount of memory (RAM) and a Linux operating system. Thus, data sampling becomes quite easy even for user-space applications. This implementation tries to estimate an upper bound for I/O throughput. The findings are available in [Throughput.pdf] (https://github.com/ma16/rpio/raw/release.1/doc/Throughput.pdf).
