# Raspberry Pi Input Output (RPIO)

This is a project to ease C++11 access to the Raspberry Pi's peripherals. The implementation is far from being finished. Present interfaces may and will change at any time.

**Note**: The Raspberry Pi is **no** open-source platform. Many details regarding the hardware are missing and won't be disclosed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. This starts already with simple electric characteristics. The peripherals are not described in depth and the datasheet is riddled with errors. The drivers for the VideoCore are provided as Blob. Since there isn't any professionel support either, you may soon get stuck when you encounter problems. If you can live with these conditions, the Rasperry Pi is a really nice toy to play with. However, for serious projects, you most likely want to chose another platform.
