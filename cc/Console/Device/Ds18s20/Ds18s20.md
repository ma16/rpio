## ROM Family Code

The Family Code (which are 8 bits of the ROM Code) is 10h.

## Power Mode

If the “parasite power” mode (2-pin mode) is used, some operations won't be available. Also, some operations may require external power switching on the bus line. 

For the remainder of the document it will be assumed that the DS18S20 is powered by an external supply (3-pin mode).

## Temperature Range

The temperature is provided as a 9-bit [two's-complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) within a 16-bit value. The leading 7 bits are padded with the sign bit. The sign bits indicate if the temperature is positive or negative: for positive numbers they are 0 and for negative numbers 1. The temperature's absolute value is given in 0.5°C steps.

The table below list examples of digital output data and the corresponding temperature reading.

Temperature (°C) | Binary Digital Output | Hexadecimal
---: | :--- | :---
+125.0 | ... | ...
+85.0 | 0000 0000 1010 1010 | 00AAh
+25.0 | 0000 0000 0011 0010 | 0032h
+0.5 | 0000 0000 0000 0001 | 0001h
0 | 0000 0000 0000 0000 | 0000h
-0.5 | 1111 1111 1111 1111 | FFFFh
-10.0 | ... | ...
-25.0 | 1111 1111 1100 1110 | FFCEh
-55.0 | 1111 1111 1001 0010 | FF92h

## Memory

The DS18S20's memory consists of an SRAM scratch-pad:

Byte | Access | Name | Initial Value
---: | :--- | :--- | :---
 0 | RO | Temperature LSB | AAh
 1 | RO | Temperature MSB | 00h
 2 | RW | High Threshold Alarm (TH) | loaded from EEPROM
 3 | RW | Low Threshold Alarm (TL) | loaded from EEPROM
 4 | RO | Reserved | always FFh
 5 | RO | Reserved | always FFh
 6 | RO | Count Remain | 0Ch 
 7 | RO | Count Per °C | always 10h
 8 | RO | CRC for bytes 0 through 7

The DS18S20 powers-up in a low-power idle state and the initial values are assigned to the registers. The  power-on reset value of the temperature register is for instance +85°C which is 00AAh.

A [CRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check)-8 register is provided and will be updated after each modification. The polynomial function is: x^8 + x^5 + x^4 + 1 (0x31); which is the same as for the 1-Wire Bus-System. 

## Domain Extension

Temperature with a resolution greater than 9 bits can be calculated from the temperature register, the Count-Remain register and the Count-Per-°C register in the sratch-pad memory using the following equation:

TEMPERATURE = (TEMP_READ - 0.25) + (COUNT_PER_C - COUNT_REMAIN) / COUNT_PER_C

The TEMP_READ value is obtained by truncating the 0.5°C bit (bit 0) from the temperature data. 

## Alarm

There is nonvolatile EEPROM backup storage for the Alarm registers. Data in the EEPROM registers is retained while the device is powered down; at power-up the EEPROM data is reloaded into the corresponding scratch-pad locations.

After the DS18S20 performs a temperature measurement, the temperature value is compared to the user-defined two’s complement Alarm trigger values stored in the TH and TL registers. These registers hold the threshold in °C which is half of the resolution of the temperature registers which have a resolution of 0.5 °C. Hence, bit 0 is clipped and only bits 8 through 1 of the temperature are used in the TH and TL comparison.

An Alarm condition exists if the measured temperature is lower than or equal to TL or higher than TH. The Alarm flag inside the DS18S20 is set according to the Alarm condition and updated after every temperature measurement; therefore, if the Alarm condition goes away, the flag will be turned off.

The Master device can check the Alarm flag status of all DS18S20s on the bus by issuing an Alarm-Search ROM command. Any DS18S20s with a set alarm flag will respond to the command, so the Master can determine exactly which DS18S20s have experienced an Alarm condition. If an Alarm condition exists and the TH or TL settings have changed, another temperature measurement should be initiated to validate the Alarm condition.

If the DS18S20 Alarm function is not used, the Alarm registers can serve as general-purpose memory.

## Functions

The Functions listed below are provided by the DS18S20:

| # | Command | Description 
---: | :--- | :--- 
44 | Convert T | Start temperature measurement.
4E | Write Sratch-Pad | Write TH and TL.
48 | Copy Sratch-Pad | Save TH and TL to EEPROM.
B8 | Recall E2 | Restore TH and TL from EEPROM.
B4 | Read Power Supply | Read power-supply mode.
BE | Read Sratch-Pad | Read entire 9-byte sratch-pad.

The DS18S20 needs to be addressed by ROM command before a Function can be invoked.

### Convert T

This Function initiates a temperature measurement. The resulting thermal data is stored after a while in the temperature registers and the DS18S20 returns to its low-power idle state.

The Master may issue Read-Time-Slot signals and the DS18S20 will respond by transmitting 0 while the operation is in progress and 1 when the operation is completed.

### Write Sratch-Pad

This Function writes the TH and TL registers. Data must be transmitted least significant bit first (i.e. starting with LSB of TH). The Master may want to read-back the scratch-pad and verify the CRC.

The data on the scratch-pad may be corrupted if the Master issues an early Reset Pulse; i.e. before all bits have been transmitted.

### Read Sratch-Pad

This Function reads the contents of the sratch-pad. The data transfer starts with the least significant bit of byte 0 and continues through the sratch-pad until the 9th byte is read. The Master may start a new transaction with a Reset Pulse at any time if only part of the sratch-pad data is needed.

### Copy Sratch-Pad

This Function initiates a backup of the TH and TL registers to EEPROM.

The Master may issue Read-Time-Slot signals and the DS18S20 will respond by transmitting 0 while the operation is in progress and 1 when the operation is completed.

### Recall E2

This Function initiates the restoration of the TH and TL registers from EEPROM.

The Master may issue Read-Time-Slot signals and the DS18S20 will respond by transmitting 0 while the operation is in progress and 1 when the operation is completed.

This operation is performed automatically at power-up.

### Read Power-Supply

This Function must be followed by a Read-Time-Slot signal. A parasite-powered DS18S20s will pull the bus Low; externally powered DS18S20s won't respond.

A parasite-powered DS18S20 won't provide all operations and needs explicit power switching of the bus line.
