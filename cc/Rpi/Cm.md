# Clock Manager (CM)

The [BCM2835 ARM Peripherals](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf) document does not include the Clock Manager. It describes only the three General Purpose GPIO Clocks (ยง6.3). However, there are more clock generators, for example for PWM and PCM. Please refer also to the errata section at the end of this page.

## Register Block

The base-address of the register-block is 7E10:1000.

The eLinux project lists 114 registers. These include:

| | CTL | DIV
:--- | ---: | ---:
GP0 | 70 | 74
GP1 | 78 | 7C
GP2 | 80 | 84
PCM | 98 | 9C
PWM | A0 | A4
SLIM | A8 | AC
UART | F0 | F4

Each of these clock generators is set-up by a control register and by a divider. 

The maximum operating frequency of the General Purpose clocks (GP0,GP1,GP2) is ~125MHz at 1.2V. This will be reduced if the GPIO pins are heavily loaded or have a capacitive load.

Don't do any changes to GP1 on Raspberry Pi models that provide an Ethernet interface. GP1 seems to provide the Ethernet clock.

## Control Register (CTL)

Offset | Bits | Access | Name | Description
---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | :---
0 | 4 | RW | SRC | Clock Source
4 | 1 | RW | ENAB | Enable and disable clock generator
5 | 1 | WO | KILL | Kill the clock generator
7 | 1 | RO | BUSY | Reflects whether the clock is running (or not)
8 | 1 | RW | FLIP | Invert output
9 | 2 | RW | MASH | A filter to put fractional-divider-jitter out of the audio band
24 | 8 |WO | PASSWD | Writing the register succeeds only if set to 5A

### Clock Source (CTL.SRC)

To avoid lock-ups and glitches do not change this control while BUSY=1 and do not change this control at the same time as asserting ENAB. 

There are 16 sources:

Number | Name | Frequency
---: | :--- | :---
1 | oscillator | 1.92e+7
2 | testdebug0 | 0.00e+0
3 | testdebug1 | 0.00e+0
4 | PLLA | 0.00e+0
5 | PLLC | 1.00e+9 .. 1.20e+9 
6 | PLLD | 5.00e+8
7 | HDMI | 0.00e+0 .. (1.08e+08) .. 2.16e+8
other | GND | 0.00e+0

Only source *1* and *6* appear to have the same frequency on all Raspberry Pi models. The frequency of PLLC and HDMI seems to vary.

### Start and Stop (CTL.ENAB)

This requests the clock to start or stop without glitches. The output clock will not stop immediately because the cycle must be allowed to complete to avoid glitches. The BUSY flag will go low when the final cycle is completed. 

### Stop Immediately (CTL.KILL)

KILL=0 has no effect.

KILL=1: Stop and reset the clock generator. This is intended for test/debug only. Using this control may cause a glitch on the clock generator output.

Note, this is no single-shot operation. The application has to set the flag, and then to clear it again. This may become necessary when a clock-generator gets stuck.

### Status (CTL.BUSY)

The flag indicates whether the clock generator is running. To avoid glitches and lockups, configuration must not change while this flag is set. 

### Invert Output (CTL.FLIP)

This is intended for use in test/debug only. Switching this flag will generate an edge on the clock generator output. To avoid output glitches do not switch this control while BUSY=1

### Audio-Band Noise-Shaping (CTL.MASH)

The fractional divider operates by periodically dropping clock pulses. Therefore the output frequency will switch between SRC/INTGR and SRC/(INTGR+1). The resulting jitter may affect the audio band.

A MASH noise-shaping can be applied to push the jitter out of the audio band by spreading the actual frequency around the requested frequency. This noise shaping shall not be exposed to frequencies higher than 25 MHz.

| # | Description
---: | :---
0 | The fractional part of the divider is not used at all.
1 | The fractional part of the divider is used, but no noise-shaping.
2 | The fractional part of the divider is used, and noise-shaping.
3 | The fractional part of the divider is used, and more noise-shaping.

According to [eLinux](http://elinux.org/BCM2835_registers#CM), GP2 and UART do not support noise shaping; i.e. only values #0 and #1 are supported.

The frequency divider fluctuates as follows:

| # | min | average | max
---: | :--- | :--- | :---
0 | INTGR   | INTGR                | INTGR
1 | INTGR   | INTGR + FRACT / 4096 | INTGR+1
2 | INTGR-1 | INTGR + FRACT / 4096 | INTGR+2
3 | INTGR-3 | INTGR + FRACT / 4096 | INTGR+4

Each of the MASH filters imposes a minimum INTGR value:

| # | INTGR
---: | :---
0 | >= 1
1 | >= 2
2 | >= 3
3 | >= 5

To avoid lock-ups and glitches do not change the MASH control while BUSY=1 and do not change this control at the same time as asserting ENAB. 

## Divider Register (DIV)

Offset | Bits | Access | Name | Alias | Description
---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
0 | 12 | RW | DIVF | FRACT | Fractional part of divisor
12 | 12 | RW | DIVI | INTGR | Integer part of divisor
24 | 8 | WO | PASSWD | | Writing the register succeeds only if set to 5A

According to [eLinux](http://elinux.org/BCM2835_registers#CM), UART supports only 22 instead of 24 INTGR+FRACT bits. Bit:0-7 appear to be FRACT and Bit:8-21 appear to be INTGR.

## Test Cases

### Test-Case: 1

In order to determine an oscillator frequency, the oscillator source is tapped to the PWM clock-generator; the PWM peripheral is switched into FIFO mode; and the time to clock-out a bit-stream is taken. The values above were measured on Pi-0/2/3 with different configurations. Treat them with caution. Anyway, the results correlate with those of other users at [stackexchange.com](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/1153/what-are-the-different-clock-sources-for-the-general-purpose-clocks#23277).

```
$ rpio cm config pwm -i 10 -m 0 -s 1 ;\
  rpio cm switch pwm on ;\
  rpio pwm range 1 1000 ;\
  rpio pwm control -pwen2 +usef1 +mode1 +pwen1 ;\
  rpio pwm frequency
1.92e+06 (1.92e+03,0)
```

This reports for clock-source 1 (-s) a a rate of 1.92e+3 words per second, with a word-size (range) of 1,000 bits and a divider (-i) of 10. That makes 19.2 MHz.

```
$ rpio cm config pwm -i 10 -m 0 -s 6 ;\
  rpio cm switch pwm on ;\
  rpio pwm range 1 1000 ;\
  rpio pwm control -pwen2 +usef1 +mode1 +pwen1 ;\
  rpio pwm frequency
5.00e+07 (5.00e+04,0)
```
For clock-source 6 (-s) it is 500 MHz.
